<p>Adaptive rowing is a special category of rowing for those with physical disabilities. Our adaptive rowing program is currently in development. Please contact Landon Bartley at <span class='email'>landon[at]grrowing.org</span> if you are interested in learning more about adaptive opportunities with the club or if you or your organization is interested in funding this program!</p>
