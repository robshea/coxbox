<p>Landon Bartley was a varsity rower and executive board member for Michigan State University Men's Rowing for the 2002 - 2005 seasons. In that capacity he eventually achieved a USRA Level III coaching certification, and also holds the distinction of being the largest person to ever cox a junior girls' 8+ shell, one fateful day in the summer of 2004. He was varsity men's head coach for the GRRA's junior program, from 2007 to 2011. Landon currently works for the City of Grand Rapids, and received a Bachelor's Degree in Linguistics and a Masters Degree in Urban Planning from Michigan State University.</p>

<p>Landon is the current GRRA President, and his goals continue to be wild expansion of the club's membership and programs, working with volunteers and area coaches to host and cohost bigger and better regattas, the continued financial stability and sustainability of the club, and recruiting and retaining junior members from community schools, especially for underserved populations.</p>
