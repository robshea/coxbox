<p>Eric Kazmierski joined the GRRA coaching staff in 2008 as assistant coach for the men's junior rowing program, and became the novice men's coach later that year. He was the varsity men's head coach for the junior rowing program until 2012, when he became boathouse manager for the GRRA. He also was assistant coach for the 2012 summer Adult Learn to Scull classes. He is currently Head Coach of East Grand Rapids High School's rowing program.</p>

<p>Eric began his rowing career at Michigan State where he rowed for three years in both lightweight and heavyweight weight classes. His favorite aspect of the sport is the strong correlation between work and results.  A self-described ‘rowing nerd’, he follows collegiate and national team rowing news like many follow professional sports.  In his spare time, Eric studies elite training methods and technique and is working to help incorporate those elements into his training plans.</p>

<p>He is currently pursuing a degree in Sustainable Business from Aquinas College.</p>
