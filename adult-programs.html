<p>The outdoor rowing season starts in April and runs through early November. Our objective is to offer a good rowing experience to both competitive and non-competitive rowers. The adult rowing program has two components:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='#adultrec'>Adult Recreational rowing</a></li>
<li><a href='#masters'>Masters Competitive rowing</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Adult Recreational Rowing</h2>

<p><em><a href='/about/coaches/dave'>Head Coach Dave Morrison</a></em></p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>Recreational rowing focuses largely on giving participants solid aerobic exercise and a great social experience with other rowers, but little training is devoted toward competition at regattas. Rowers unable to participate in the competitive program but wishing to race may consider forming independent crews with other certified rowers.</p>

<h3>Practice Times</h3>

<p>Adult rec practices are held every Wednesday beginning at 6:00 pm (please try to arrive at least 15 minutes early to stretch out and be ready to go!) and run for approximately two hours. Saturday practices begin at 8:00 am and will run until 9:30.</p>

<h3>Dues</h3>

<p>Adult recreation rowing is included with Individual, Family and College Student <a href='/adult/membership'>memberships</a> at no additional cost.</p>

<h2>Masters Competitive Rowing</h2>

<p><em><a href='/about/coaches/lauren'>Head Coach Lauren Holben</a></em></p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>The competitive rowing program will aim to push athletes to a higher level of performance by focusing on cardio endurance, precise technique, and race preparation. Rowers will compete in various regattas throughout the state and possibly regionally as well.</p>

<h3>Practice Times</h3>

<p>Competitive practices typically run Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 6-8 PM from the beginning of April until November. June-mid August practice time moves to 5-7 in the morning due to Learn to Row classes. Masters crew team members are expected to be at all practices, be on time, and give 100% effort both at practice and at regattas.</p>

<h3>Getting on a Crew</h3>

<p>Members joining the club or wishing to join the competitive team mid-season may be accepted with permission from the head coach. Those interested should have completed Learn to Row and have several sessions of Adult Rec rowing completed, or similar experience.</p>
