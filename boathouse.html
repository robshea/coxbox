<h2>Boathouse</h2>

<p>The Grand Rapids boathouse is the GRRA's home base during the warmer months. It is located at <a href="/boathouse/directions">291 North Park St. NW</a> just north of Grand Rapids city limits, behind Greenleaf Landscaping. Use the Greenleaf Landscaping entrance to reach the boathouse.</p>

<p>Certified members have free access to the boathouse during the day so they can row at their convenience. The White Pine Trail is visible behind the boathouse in the aerial photo above, which gives great access for members and guests wishing to bike or hike!</p>
