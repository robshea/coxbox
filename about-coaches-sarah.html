<p>In 2009, Sarah signed up for a Learn to Row class and fell in love with the sport.  She joined the club and has occasionally coxed for a variety of the club's programs, in addition to serving as stroke for several of the club's masters crews.  Sarah enjoys rowing on the erg when Michigan weather does not allow on-water rowing, and is thrilled to be coaching indoor rowing beginning in 2013.</p>

<p>She is the captain of the masters women's squad, and spearheaded the "Eights for Hope" initiative, which in its first year raised over $5000 for cancer research efforts at the Van Andel Research Institute. Her long-term goal for the rowing club is to help set up an adaptive rowing program to make the joys of rowing accessible for all.</p>
