<h2>Volunteer</h2>

<p>One big way is by volunteering to help us out around the boathouse or at regattas. We ask all members to help out as part of their membership; but anyone is welcome to keep the club moving along! Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> for volunteer opportunities (members, sign in and check the "Stewardship" page).</p>

<h2>Give a Gift of Rowing</h2>

<p>Maybe you decided that rowing's just not for you (yet!), but you know that your family, friends, coworkers, or acquaintances would really enjoy it! Purchase a <strong>gift certificate</strong> from the GRRA, which can be used for Learn to Row, Learn to Scull, or Indoor Rowing classes; memberships; private coaching, and more! A GRRA gift certificate makes a great gift!</p>
