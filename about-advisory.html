<p><em>President Emeritus, Grand Valley State University</em></p>

<p>Arend D. Lubbers became president of Grand Valley in 1969 at the age of 37, making him one of the youngest university presidents in the nation. When he retired in 2001, he was the longest-serving public university president in the country. In the 32 years in between, Lubbers led the university’s evolution from a small, liberal arts college to a regional university. Lubbers guided the university’s response to regional education needs with the establishment of the Seidman College of Business, the Kirkhof College of Nursing, and the Schools of Education, Social Work, Health Sciences, Engineering, and Communication. Also during his tenure, GVSU’s programs in music, art, chemistry, education, social work, business, and nursing have earned professional accreditations. Lubbers Stadium on the Allendale Campus is named for him.</p>

<p>Lubbers is a native of Holland, Mich. and a graduate of Hope College, where his father, Irwin Lubbers, served as president. He received his master’s degree in history from Rutgers University in 1956, and then taught at Wittenberg College in Ohio before returning to Rutgers in 1958 to pursue his doctorate. In 1962, Life magazine named him to its list of the top 100 young men under 40 in the United States. Lubbers came to Grand Valley from Central College, in Pella, Iowa, where he had served as president for nine years. At the time of his appointment to that position, Lubbers, at 29, was the youngest college president in the country. Don’s support of rowing started with his commitment to support and continue the rowing club at Grand Valley State, which has grown into a powerhouse among Midwest collegiate rowing programs. The recent “Lubbers Cup” regatta, held in Spring Lake, MI, was one of the largest regattas yet hosted by the University. Lubbers was also instrumental as a community advocate of the GRRA, and served as co-chair of the capital campaign for the new boathouse.</p>
