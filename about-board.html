<h2>Elected Board Members</h2>

<p>Board members serve for a one-year term and are elected by the members at the club's annual membership meeting each February. Club members: Please contact the current club President by February 1, if you are interested in serving on the board. Officers are selected by the Board of Directors directly following the election.</p>

<p>The following elected positions comprise the Board of Directors:</p>

<h3>President - Landon Bartley</h3>

<p>Landon Bartley was a varsity rower and executive board member for Michigan State University Men’s Rowing for the 2002 – 2005 seasons. In that capacity he eventually achieved a USRA Level III coaching certification, and also holds the distinction of being the largest person to ever cox a junior girls' 8+ shell, one fateful day in the summer of 2004.</p>

<p>Landon currently works for the City of Grand Rapids, and received both a Bachelor's Degree in Linguistics as well as a Masters Degree in Urban Planning from Michigan State University. Landon's goals as President continue to be wild expansion of the club's membership and programs, working with volunteers and area coaches to host and cohost bigger and better regattas, the continued financial stability and sustainability of the club, and recruiting and retaining junior members from community schools, especially for underserved populations.</p>

<h3>Treasurer - Caitlin Quantock</h3>

<p>Caitlin learned to row in Ann Arbor, and enjoyed the first year of Saline High School’s rowing program as a senior there in 2004. While she did not compete at Michigan State University, she did party like a rock star while earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. Caitlin leapt back in to the sport of rowing upon moving to Grand Rapids in 2012 for a job as an accounts payable auditor for PRGX, which naturally led to the position of Treasurer for GRRA. This year she has also learned to scull in one of the many classes offered by our coaching staff. Her favorite part of rowing is the camaraderie among athletes of this specialized sport, and the necessary use of teamwork to accomplish great feats.</p>

<h3>Secretary - Karin Cramer</h3>

<p>Karin discovered rowing when her daughter (who now rows with the GRRA high school team) was a novice rower and coxswain. She started Learn-to-Row in June 2012 and rowed (sweep or scull) several times weekly until dock out in November.  For the 2013 season, Karin rowed with the Masters team. (And loved it!)  She looks forward to helping the Club however possible.</p>

<h3>Boathouse Director - Walt Alexander</h3>

<p>Walt Alexander grew up in North East, Maryland, a little town located at the north end of the Chesapeake Bay. He went on active duty with the U.S. Army soon after high school graduation and was fortunate to spend most of his 3+ year enlistment in Germany. There Walt met a soldier from Riverview, Michigan … his wife Donna. They originally came to Grand Rapids so that Walt could attend Electronics School, and found a town they liked and for Walt a part-time job that turned into a 30+ year career.  Walt works at Micron Manufacturing, a small, family-owned company that produces precision machined parts, where his duties include estimating and directing safety, health, and environmental efforts.</p>

<p>Walt got interested in rowing after going to a regatta in Grand Rapids to watch Donna’s niece Kelli compete as a member of the Riverview HS team. He took an Adult Learn-To-Row at the GRRA in 2009 and not only found rowing to be fun and a great workout, but it’s a great way to make new friends.  Walt decided to seek a position on the Board, after realizing that there’s a lot of work going on behind the scenes that makes GRRA possible. Aside from continuing to compete and help out at regattas and around the Boathouse, he hopes to encourage greater member participation and maybe even find some new members. See ya on the water!</p>

<h3>Safety Director - Renee Zuidema</h3>

<p>Renee Zuidema works full-time as a Network Analyst at X-Rite, Incorporated.  When time allows, she loves to be on or near water.  A friend told her about the Learn To Row classes at GRRA and she decided to give it a try for at least a year.  She took her first Learn To Row class in the Spring of 2012 and was hooked... and Learn To Scull is on the agenda for 2013.  She is hoping to help spread the word about the great programs offered at GRRA.</p>
