</div>

<p>A private coaching session with one of the GRRA's experienced coaches can be a great way to get back on the river without committing (yet) to a full membership, or to get a little bit more one-on-one attention to hone your skills in a single. It's also a great gift for rowers!</p>

<p>Rates vary for each coach. Please check out our Coaches page or the links below so you can review each coach's profile and figure out who you would like to work with!</p>
