</div>

<p>Membership is for adult programs. For Junior Programs, see <a href="/junior">Junior Programs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE: AS OF 4/1/2014, the membership fees and structures will change!</strong></p>

<p>The $100 crew fee is being absorbed into the membership fee, so it will not have to be paid separately. This means that Individual memberships will be $300. Family memberships will be $400. Social, student, and rack fees will remain the same.</p>

<p>Monthly memberships are going away. Instead, anyone joining or renewing can now use <a href='https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/billmelater-productoverview'>PayPal's "BillMeLater" service</a>, which allows you to pay the cost of membership on your own terms. (You will need to set up a PayPal account to take advantage of this service).</p>
