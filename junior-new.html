<h2>Welcome to a great team!</h2>

<p>Rowing is the ultimate team sport. Rowers work together in long, sleek racing shells and push the boundaries of their physical limits to make the crew successful. Unlike traditional sports such as baseball, football, tennis, or soccer, virtually all <strong>Grand Rapids Junior Rowing</strong> athletes have no prior rowing experience. In this respect, crew can be a fresh start in a sport that is increasing in popularity across the country.</p>

<p>If you truly enjoy new challenges and have the drive to work hard, the rewards of rowing with <strong>Grand Rapids Junior Rowing</strong> can be great.</p>

<p>Junior rowers develop high levels of physical strength and learn new skills while having fun, making friends, and testing their rowing prowess against teams from across the Midwest.</p>

<h2>Regattas - Get ready to race!</h2>

<p>You won’t sit the bench in crew. Known as <em>regattas</em>, rowing competitions have events divided by skill, weight, gender, and boat type. This affords every team member the chance to compete for medals. We typically compete in 3-4 regattas during the Fall season, 1-2 indoor regattas in the Winter, 3-4 regattas in the Spring and 1-2 regattas in the Summer.</p>

<h2>Novice, JV &amp; Varsity</h2>

<p>First year rowers are considered <em>novices</em>. <em>Junior varsity</em> (JV) races are restricted to 9th – 11th grades. Any qualified rower can be in a <em>Varsity</em> race. We typically have a novice team and varsity team. A number of GR Junior rowers have placed in national competitions (including one recent national gold medal) and many have gone on to earn seats in collegiate crews (some with full scholarships).</p>

<h2>Seasons</h2>

<p>GR Junior Rowing offers rowing opportunities throughout the year (including an indoor winter conditioning program). Practices in the fall and spring are usually Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings, and Saturday mornings. Most regattas are scheduled for Saturdays and/or Sundays. If weather conditions are adverse, rowers will be contacted regarding practice cancellation.</p>

<h2>Equipment and Facilities</h2>

<p>Our boathouse and dock are located on the Grand River at 291 North Park Street NW. <em>Use the Greenleaf Landscaping entrance to get to the boathouse.</em> We are lucky to have a fantastic stretch of the Grand River for practice, and also have nearly 200 feet of dock for launching. The team’s fleet of boats consists of shells designed for 1, 2, 4, or 8 rowers. Most of our racing is known as “sweep” rowing in boats of four and eight rowers. Sweep rowers each use one 12 foot long oar, as opposed to “sculling” where the rower has two smaller ~10 foot oars, and is usually done in doubles or singles. There are plenty of opportunities for everyone to row.</p>

<h3>Eights</h3>

<p>The biggest and fastest boats are the eights, which are nearly sixty feet in length and weigh approximately 210 – 240 pounds. They have eight rowers and a coxswain (pronounced COX-n). While the coxswain does not row, he or she is extremely important. Besides steering the shell, the coxswain serves as an on- board coach to lead and coordinate the crew with a series of commands.</p>

<p>In addition to boats and oars, the rowing team has a trailer for hauling our boats to regattas, several motorized coaching/safety launches that are on the water during practice, and rowing machines for indoor conditioning. We have several tents, tables, stoves, and other equipment used to provide meals, shelter, and a place to rest for our rowers during the day-long regattas.</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<h3>Grand Rapids Rowing Association</h3>

<p>Grand Rapids Junior Rowing is the high school program of the <em>Grand Rapids Rowing Association</em>. The organization is primarily self-funded, and operation relies heavily on memberships, program fees, and donations for support. The Grand Rapids Rowing Association is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, and all donations are fully tax-deductible.</p>

<h3>Grand Rapids Junior Rowing Boosters</h3>

<p>The <em>Grand Rapids Junior Rowing Boosters</em> is the committee of volunteers that makes rowing possible. Comprised of parents of rowers, the crew boosters provide many services such as team organization, scheduling, financing, fundraising, rowing shell and equipment purchases, team travel arrangements, and regatta support, which enable our rowers to perform at the highest levels. Everyone is welcome to become a <a href="junior/booster">Grand Rapids Junior Rowing Booster</a>!</p>

<h2>Cost of Rowing</h2>

<p>The basic cost of rowing is determined before each season. In addition to the usual expenses of equipment, coaching, and team operations, the fee includes regatta entry fees and the cost of a basic racing uniform.</p>

<h3>Clothing</h3>

<p>Rowers may purchase sweatshirts, hats and rowing jackets from the team at reasonable prices. Rowers will need running shoes for conditioning and “weather appropriate” athletic clothing. Novice rowers usually wear team t-shirts or mesh jerseys for racing, while varsity rowers purchase a unisuit, a one-piece spandex uniform in GR colors that is specifically designed for top rowing performance.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>Parents are responsible for ensuring that their athletes have transportation to and from practices, regattas, and other team events, as well as nutritious food, and often travel with the team to out-of-town regattas when possible (We do encourage carpooling to events). Spring and Fall regattas may incur addition costs for transportation and lodging.</p>

<h3>Cost per Season</h3>

<p>Spring and Fall seasons dues are $300 each. Winter and Summer seasons are $150. When one considers the athletic opportunities, the competition, the teamwork, the personal and physical development, the skills learned, the adventures and the fun, Grand Rapids Junior Rowing is an exceptional value.</p>

<h3>Donations and Scholarships</h3>

<p>Generous donations from organizations and individuals have helped us keep costs to the athletes and their families much lower than would otherwise be possible. We do have a limited amount of scholarship money available for rowers in need, and are working with several area organizations to expand sponsorship and scholarship opportunities for athletes.</p>
