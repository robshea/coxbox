<p>Brian began sculling seriously in 2009 with the Greater Houston Rowing Association. After several years rowing quads, in late 2012 he moved to single and doubles.  Brian enjoys the intensity and test of competition as well as the challenge to continuously improve stroke technique.  Brian attended Craftsbury’s sculling camp in 2013 with plans to return in 2014.</p>

<p>He has been a club member since retiring to Grand Rapids in 2012, and in 2013 has taught beginning and intermediate club sculling classes.</p>
